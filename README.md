# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project involved creating an ETL pipeline using python, pandas and regular expressions to extract and transform data.

A base crowdfunding Excel file was used to create category and subcategory csv files for later sql classification. A campaign dataframe was also created from this Excel file too. A contacts dataframe was formed from the contacts Excel file using Python methods. Finally an SQL database including all of the above was formed as well as an ERD.

## NOTE:
The campaign Excel file needed to have the items in the "goal" column to be reformatted into numbers with no decimal places using the "Format Cells" tool.

Additionally, screenshots of the SQL tables appearing after using the SQL code are contained within the "SQL Table Screenshots" folder.
